The vizualization script assumes you have set the folder containing the github files as your WD.
A conda environment is recommended - this script was written under Python 3.7.7 and requires the
dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file located within this folder, which was created using pip freeze.
pip install can then be used to install packages directly from this requirement file.
